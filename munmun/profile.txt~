Vice President Johnson, Mr. Speaker, Mr. Chief Justice, President Eisenhower,
Vice President Nixon, President Truman, Reverend Clergy, fellow citizens:

symbolizing an end as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal as well as
change. For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our
forbears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago.
